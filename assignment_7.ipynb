    "For this assignment we will explore Neural Networks; in particular, we are going to explore model complexity. We will use the same dataset from Assignment #6 to classify a mushroom as either edible ('e') or poisonous ('p'). You are free to use PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn -- to name a few resources. The goal is to explore different model complexities (architectures) before declaring a winner. Either start with a simple network and make it more complex; or start with a complex model and pare it down. Either way, your submission should clearly demonstrate your exploration.\n",

    "### Neural Networks: Architecture Exploration for Mushroom Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, the goal was to explore different neural network architectures for classifying mushrooms as either edible ('e') or poisonous ('p'). We experimented with three different network complexities to find the best model that generalizes well to new data. The dataset from Assignment #6 was used, and we employed cross-validation to evaluate each model’s performance. Finally, the best model was selected, and its performance on the test set was reported.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology:\n",
    "We experimented with three different network architectures, each with a varying number of layers and units. The complexity of each network was increased in successive models to understand how they affect generalization (i.e., their ability to perform well on unseen data). The architectures tested were:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model 1:** [6] - A simple network with one hidden layer containing 6 units.\n",
    "2. **Model 2:** [12, 6] - A more complex network with two hidden layers: 12 units in the first and 6 in the second.\n",
    "3. **Model 3:** [18, 12, 6] - The most complex network with three hidden layers: 18 units in the first, 12 in the second, and 6 in the third.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Cross-validation\n",
    "Each model was evaluated using 8-fold cross-validation, where the dataset was split into training and validation sets. For each fold, we computed the training error and validation error. We also calculated the mean and standard deviation of errors across all folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Model Complexity and Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "We were particularly concerned with **bias** (underfitting) and **variance** (overfitting):\n",
    "- **Model 1** (simple) was expected to have higher bias, as it might not be complex enough to capture the relationships in the data.\n",
    "- **Model 2** (medium complexity) should strike a better balance between bias and variance.\n",
    "- **Model 3** (complex) was expected to have lower bias but potentially higher variance, especially if it overfits the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Model Selection\n",
    "Based on cross-validation results, we chose the model that generalizes best, meaning the one with the lowest validation error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Model 1: [6]**\n",
    "- **Train Errors:** \n",
    "  - Mean: 9.17%, Std. Dev.: 2.17%\n",
    "- **Validation Errors:** \n",
    "  - Mean: 3.39%, Std. Dev.: 1.03%\n",
    "- **Interpretation:** While this model performed reasonably well, the validation error was somewhat high, indicating potential underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Model 2: [12, 6]**\n",
    "- **Train Errors:** \n",
    "  - Mean: 6.08%, Std. Dev.: 1.27%\n",
    "- **Validation Errors:** \n",
    "  - Mean: 1.06%, Std. Dev.: 0.32%\n",
    "- **Interpretation:** This model showed a better balance between train and validation errors, with lower error on both compared to Model 1. It likely has a better fit to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Model 3: [18, 12, 6]**\n",
    "- **Train Errors:** \n",
    "  - Mean: 5.10%, Std. Dev.: 1.45%\n",
    "- **Validation Errors:** \n",
    "  - Mean: 0.38%, Std. Dev.: 0.23%\n",
    "- **Interpretation:** Model 3 achieved the lowest validation error, indicating that it generalizes extremely well. The model is complex enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data without overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Model Selection:\n",
    "**Model 3 ([18, 12, 6])** was selected as the best model based on the following reasons:\n",
    "- It had the lowest validation error (0.38%), indicating the best generalization ability.\n",
    "- It did not suffer from overfitting, as evidenced by the low validation error despite its complexity.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Test Set Performance:\n",
    "Once Model 3 was selected, we evaluated its performance on the test set (the only time this set was used). The results were as follows:\n",
    "- **Test Error:** **0.00%**\n",
    "- **Interpretation:** The test error being 0.00% confirms that Model 3 generalizes exceptionally well to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "- **Winning Model:** Model 3 with the architecture [18, 12, 6] was the best performing model.\n",
    "- **Test Performance:** Model 3 achieved **0.00% test error**, showing excellent generalization.\n",
    "- **Bias vs. Variance:** Model 3 achieved a great balance between bias and variance, fitting the data well without overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exploration successfully demonstrated how increasing model complexity can reduce bias, but it is crucial to find the right architecture that minimizes both bias and variance to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data."

    "### **Summary of Findings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Effect of Activation Functions**:\n",
    "   - **`relu` vs `tanh`**: The models with `relu` activation performed significantly better in terms of both training and validation errors in Experiment 1. `relu` provided better results than `tanh` across all architectures.\n",
    "   - **`tanh`** showed higher errors compared to `relu`, indicating that the simpler, non-saturating nature of `relu` is better suited for this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Effect of Optimizers**:\n",
    "   - **`adam`** (Experiment 1) was the most successful optimizer, achieving **perfect performance (0% test error)** for the best architecture ([18, 12, 6]).\n",
    "   - **`sgd`** (Experiment 2) performed the worst, with a test error of **7.14%**. `sgd` is less adaptive and struggles to achieve as low a test error as `adam`.\n",
    "   - **`rmsprop`** (Experiment 3) showed promising results, achieving a **test error of 0.25%**, which is very close to `adam`, suggesting that both `rmsprop` and `adam` are more effective optimizers than `sgd`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Complexity**:\n",
    "   - The **[18, 12, 6] architecture** performed best in all three experiments, with the lowest validation errors and highest consistency across folds. This indicates that a deeper, more complex model can generalize better in this case.\n",
    "   - The **[6]** architecture consistently had the highest validation errors, and the **[12, 6]** architecture performed slightly better but still did not outperform the deeper [18, 12, 6] architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Final Conclusion**:\n",
    "- **Best Performance**: The best model was the **[18, 12, 6] architecture** with **`relu` activation** and **`adam` optimizer**, achieving **perfect performance on the test set (0.00% error)**.\n",
    "- **Second Best Performance**: The second-best configuration was with **`tanh` activation** and **`rmsprop` optimizer**, achieving a **test error of 0.25%**. This combination performed well but was still outperformed by `adam`.\n",
    "- **Worst Performance**: The worst-performing configuration was with **`tanh` activation** and **`sgd` optimizer**, which resulted in a **test error of 7.14%**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, **`relu` activation** and **`adam` optimizer** in the **[18, 12, 6]** model is the best combination for this task."

    "   - **Binary Crossentropy:** The validation error for the best model with complexity `[18, 12, 6]` was **0.75%**. So, both loss functions seem to yield quite similar results, but `binary_crossentropy` led to marginally higher validation error.\n",
